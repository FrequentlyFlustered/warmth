  <p style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">This site is entirely for practicing purposes and to fulfill my first personal coding project.<br>You keep telling me to pursue my endeavors Charles, so, here I am! Doing my best like you wish me to. :)</p>
  <p>I'm attempting to test out this function so don't mind the mention below</p>

<h2 title="it's an awful place to work at and I suggest no one does it">My First Job</h2>
  <p>I'm not one for believing in fate truthfully. If it wasn't for me flunking out of two departments at this job, I would've never met Charles though. So, maybe it was fate that I didn't succeed and ended up meeting you in exchange. It's odd to say, I'm glad I never became a good pharmacy tech nor general merchanidising clerk. Instead, I became an overachieving APC (all purpose clerk) who tried too hard to impress everyone, including you, Charles.</p>

<h4><i>Tidbits From Many Conversations</i></h4>
  <p>I don't really remember all the minute details from the first few months we got to working together and talking. Admittedly, I think I was often still too focused on a certain unmentionable person that I'm embarrassed to say the name of. I think our exchange about the Dora movie is what sorta started it all, right? After that, I only remember brief conversations while you helped me learn how to become a "better" and somewhat adequate stocker over time. Once we started gangstocking though, I recall us talking more and more freely. It's where I discovered your liking of Pokemon, Pixar movies, country music, dnd, your favorite color (orange hehe), and so much more. Stocking together is also where I remember fondly joking about dumb things like the wiggles, old music the Fry's radio didn't play anymore (that I didn't even know about), and tons of memes I likely tried to show you and you had distate for them.</p>
 <h4><i>Fast Food Interlude</i></h4>
   <p>I remember one of our first food dates was at the IHop after work. I forget why or how I convinced you to come out with me, I think it was supposed to be a group interaction but only us two could go. I think, I was even suprised you still came to eat out with me... Since you know, it was only you and I.

<h2>The Garden That Started It All</h2>
  <p>Talk about our first date and the awkwardness of it all but how incredibly endearing it was too. How I was so incredibly nervous to even hug him and couldn't imagine to even kiss him at the time because nerves!!! About all the plants, the birdwatching and being teased for loving watching them act like little dogs... Browsing the gift shop together, debating on buying a souvenir as memory of our first date. Oh man and the first time traveling the bus with him; waiting in the heat for so long to return back home. Seeing the police mark and clean up an accident at the intersection while waiting. Coming back, hanging at black cat and I think MOD pizza... And him not leaving my side till 10pm. <br>

<h2>A Somber Conversation</h2>
  <p>When my insecurities were at an all out high and I let them win. I let them convince me that breaking up would be beneficial to the both of us. But, all I felt instead was how detrimental it affected me. I realized how much I despised not being able to talk to you normally on a daily basis. I listened to a lot of silly songs that put me back on my feet and made me reevaluate my decision and the reasons behind it. Reorganize my mind, fix the hamster wheel that spun out of place. One song in particular was from the movie, Meet the Robinsons -<a href="https://youtu.be/a1xaTkFG2oY" target="_blank">Another Believer</a>. Thank you for giving me a second chance, Charles.</p>

<h2 id="End">A Heartfelt Restart</h2>
  <p>It took some coaxing and a lot of hesitance from the both of us, but, as the gears of time moved, so did we. We had a lot of awkward moments, readjusting to one another, coming to terms with a lot of our flaws. I made you so insecure for so long and I'm so deeply sorry for that. I'm just glad you kept trying and persisting even during the times when I was harshest.
